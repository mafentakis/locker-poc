# locker-poc

Minimal **Java 21** Proof-of-Concept demonstrating secure, framework-free communication between a REST client, a REST server, and an MQTT publish/subscribe pair — all running as Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose, secured with self-signed mTLS certificates.

## Goals

- Show an end-to-end, secure flow:
  **REST Client → (HTTPS/mTLS) → REST Server → (MQTT/TLS) → MQTT Broker → MQTT Subscriber**
- Implement **only the `openCompartment` operation** from `DeliveryMachineBusinessFunction.Open-API-en.yaml`.
- Emit **only the `CompartmentOpenedEventMsg`** from `DeliveryMachineBusinessEvent.Open-API-en.yaml`.
- Use **pure JDK 21** (`HttpsServer`, `HttpClient`, `SSLContext`) plus the smallest possible set of libraries: **Eclipse Paho MQTTv5** + **Jackson**.
- **No application frameworks** (no Spring, no Quarkus, no Micronaut, no Jakarta EE).
- Everything buildable and runnable with `docker compose up` on Unix.

## Non-goals

- Not production-grade. Self-signed certs, hard-coded IDs, dummy business logic.
- No persistence, no auth beyond mTLS, no real locker hardware integration.
- No full OpenAPI surface — exactly **one** REST operation and **one** MQTT event.

Generated certificates are written by the `cert-init` container to `certs/`, which is git-ignored.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build all Java modules and Docker images
docker compose build

# 2. Start the stack. cert-init generates certificates inside Docker first.
docker compose up

# 3. Observe logs
docker compose logs -f rest-server mqtt-subscriber

# 4. Run the end-to-end integration test (spins the stack up/down itself)
mvn -pl integration-test -am verify
```

### Healthchecks

Every long-running container (`mosquitto`, `rest-server`, `mqtt-subscriber`) exposes a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` and every one-shot container (`rest-client`, `mqtt-publisher`) reports completion via a sentinel file. See **SPEC §6.5** for the exact commands. `depends_on` uses `condition: service_healthy` / `service_completed_successfully` so the compose graph is race-free.

### Integration test

Module `integration-test/` (JUnit 5, test scope only — no framework in production code) boots the full stack via `docker compose`, waits for all healthchecks, runs black-box checks over HTTPS + MQTT using the generated certificates, then tears the stack down. See **SPEC §10**.

## Security disclaimer

This repository is a **proof of concept**. Certificates are self-signed, private keys are stored in a local volume, IDs are hard-coded, and there is no secret management. **Do not reuse any of this in production.**
